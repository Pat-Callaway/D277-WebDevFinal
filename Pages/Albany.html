    <h2>A brief History</h2>
    <!--Section element-->
    <section>
        <p>Albany, the capital city of New York State, boasts a history that stretches back more than 400 years. Founded by Dutch colonists in 1614, it is one of the oldest surviving European settlements from the original thirteen colonies. Albany became the state capital in 1797, playing a central role in the political and economic development of New York State. Throughout the 19th century, Albany was a hub for trade and transportation, significantly benefiting from the Erie Canal, which connected the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean. The city was also a key site in the abolitionist movement and served as a station on the Underground Railroad. In the 20th century, Albany experienced a period of urban renewal, which reshaped the city's architecture and infrastructure. Notable landmarks include the Empire State Plaza, a testament to modernist architecture, and the historic New York State Capitol building. Today, Albany is known for its rich history, vibrant cultural scene, and as a center for higher education and technology. To learn more, click the link below!</p>
